# Background
Based on the game logic as defined in [dius_bowling](https://github.com/DiUS/coding-tests/blob/master/dius_bowling.md), with further clarification sought [here](https://bowling.sport/universal-playing-rules-chapter-2/).

# Install
`npm install`

# Run
To run the game script in _./src/main.ts_ execute `npm start`.

# Run Tests
`npm test`

# Notes

- Node v22.14.0 was used.
- Utilises ts-node with the most minimal configuration changes as its just a toy project.
- Would normally add proper build system, linter, Docker etc. etc.
